    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Mumin Yusufi from Hayward, California. I am a true student of the game and I love to continue learning. I am also a programmer and developed multiple projects. From C++ to HTML, I have a solid amount of experience under my belt. I have included three different projects in this website as well. This year in computer science, I have learned so much. I now know different types of loops, if statements, and so much more. My comprehension for this subject has increased immensely. It was a fun year and allowed me to use my creativity and incorporate it into my work. As a senior at Mt. Eden High, my K-12 journey is almost complete. Class of 2025 has never been closer and I am about to graduate. This school journey was definitely one to remember. From a global pandemic in the middle of it, along with random unforgettable moments mixed in through the years. There were highs and lows but I am definitely proud of my achievements. Now as I graduate, the learning never stops. I will continue to explore and learn new content. Whether that be mentally, physically, or spiritually, I am ready to tackle more opportunities and grow as a person.</p>
