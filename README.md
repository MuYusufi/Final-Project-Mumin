Final Portfolio Project - Mumin Y.

👋 About Me  
Hi, I’m Mumin Y., a student developer with a passion for technology, design, and human-centered innovation. I’m graduating from Mt. Eden High School and plan to pursue a career that blends hands-on work, business, and creativity. This year, I stepped into the world of web development and discovered how much I enjoy building interactive projects that solve real problems and express who I am.

📚 What This Project Is  
This portfolio project is a reflection of everything I’ve learned in computer science this year. From writing clean HTML and CSS to creating dynamic user experiences with JavaScript, I’ve gained the tools to bring my ideas to life. Building this portfolio taught me not just how to code, but how to think like a developer—organizing content, designing for users, and solving problems through experimentation and iteration.

🌐 What My Portfolio Site Includes  
A Homepage with multiple sections  
An About Me section highlighting my background and goals  
A Projects section featuring all of my major coding projects  
Clean visual design and mobile-friendly layout 

💻 Featured Projects  
Meme Generator – A fun, interactive web app that lets users create custom memes by selecting images and adding top/bottom text. It helped me learn DOM manipulation and user input handling.  

Weight Converter – A tool for converting weights between pounds and kilograms. I built this to practice form input, basic functions, and responsive layout.  

Color Switcher – A simple app that changes the background color of the site dynamically. It taught me how to use JavaScript events and conditionals in a creative way.
