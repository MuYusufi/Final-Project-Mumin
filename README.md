# Final Portfolio Project – Mumin Y.

## 👋 About Me
Hi, I’m Mumin Yusufi, a senior at Mt. Eden High School in Hayward, California. I’m a passionate learner who enjoys exploring new concepts and building creative, interactive projects. This year, I dove into the world of web development, applying both logic and design to make functional and visually appealing websites. I’ve used C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create several unique projects. As I prepare to graduate with the Class of 2025, I’m proud of how far I’ve come—and I’m excited for what’s next.

## 📚 About This Project
This portfolio is the culmination of my work in computer science this year. It showcases my growth as a web developer and includes interactive projects I designed and coded myself. I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build dynamic websites, apply logic using loops and conditionals, and make pages responsive and engaging. More importantly, I discovered how to express creativity through code.
